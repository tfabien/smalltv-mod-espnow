The GeekMagic SmallTV is a cheap desk gadget: a little cube with a 1.54" colour screen, an ESP inside, and a USB-C port. This firmware throws away the stock apps and turns it into three things you actually watch. It shows a **stock and crypto ticker** with prices, change, and a sparkline. It flips into a **Claude usage meter** with an animated mascot and your 5-hour and 7-day usage bars. And it becomes a **live plane radar** centred on your location, pulled from a free public feed. One image carries all three; you switch between them in a built-in web UI, and you update over WiFi.

This firmware builds for three boards from one codebase. The original SmallTV runs an **ESP8266**; a second version sold under the same "smart weather clock" look uses an **ESP32-C2 (ESP8684)** instead. A third build targets the **NMMiner NM-TV-154** (PCB marked "NM-TV-Miner"), a classic-ESP32 BTC lottery miner in the same cube with the same screen, confirmed working by a community tester in [issue #1](https://github.com/giovi321/smalltv-mod/issues/1). Pick yours below.

## Which one do I have

Check the board before you build, because the variants flash differently.

| | SmallTV (ESP8266) | SmallTV (ESP32-C2) | NM-TV-154 (ESP32) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Photo | <img src="docs/public/assets/product-8266.png" alt="The SmallTV (ESP8266)" width="240"> | <img src="docs/public/assets/product-c2.png" alt="The SmallTV (ESP32-C2)" width="240"> | <img src="docs/public/assets/product-esp32.png" alt="The NM-TV-154 (ESP32)" width="240"> |
| MCU | ESP-12F (ESP8266), 4 MB flash | ESP32-C2 / ESP8684, 4 MB flash | ESP32-WROOM-32E, 4 MB flash |
| Build env | `smalltv` | `smalltv_c2` | `smalltv_esp32` |
| Display | 1.54" 240×240 IPS ST7789 | same panel, RGB order | same panel |
| Flashing | OTA from the stock web UI, or UART header | USB-C via the onboard CH340C (esptool) | USB via esptool |
| Tell-tale | ESP8266 module, no USB-serial chip | CH340C chip next to the USB-C port | PCB reads "NM-TV-Miner" |

If your board has a **CH340C** chip beside the USB-C port and the main chip reads **ESP8684**, you have the ESP32-C2 model. Full teardown photos and pin maps are in [Hardware and variants](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/getting-started/hardware/).

## What it does

- **Stock and crypto ticker.** Price, absolute change, percent change with an up/down arrow, and a sparkline. Up to 8 symbols rotate on a timer. Data comes straight from Yahoo Finance over HTTPS with no backend, or from your own webhook if you want to own the source. Stocks, ETFs, Swiss equities (`NESN.SW`), crypto (`BTC-USD`), and FX (`EURUSD=X`) all work.
- **Claude usage meter.** An animated pixel mascot plus your 5-hour and 7-day usage as big percentages with fill bars and reset countdowns. It is fed over WiFi by the [clawdmeter-daemon](https://github.com/giovi321/clawdmeter-daemon) on your PC. When the data stops, the mascot plays an idle animation until it comes back.
- **Plane radar.** A scope centred on your location with nearby aircraft as heading triangles, speed vectors, and callsign or altitude labels, from the free [adsb.fi](https://adsb.fi) API or a LAN webhook. Marker size, an altitude filter, and label decluttering are configurable.
- **Web UI for everything.** Join WiFi, pick the mode, manage the symbol list, set brightness, orientation, and colours. First boot creates a `SmallTV-Setup` hotspot with a captive portal.
- **Updates over WiFi.** Upload a firmware image from the browser (both boards), or let the ESP8266 pull the newest release from GitHub itself.

## Get the firmware

You do not need a toolchain. GitHub Actions builds the image for you.

- Every push: the **Actions** tab, latest `build` run, download the firmware artifact.
- Tagged releases (`vX.Y.Z`): attached to the [Releases](../../releases) page.

Or [build it yourself](#building-from-source).

## Flashing

The right method depends on your board. The steps below are the short version; the [Flashing guide](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/getting-started/flashing/) covers recovery, backups, and troubleshooting.

**SmallTV (ESP8266).** The stock firmware exposes an OTA updater, so you can install this without opening the device. Find its IP, browse to `http://<device-ip>/update`, and upload `smalltv-mod-firmware.bin`. Back up the stock image first if you might want it back.

**SmallTV (ESP32-C2).** Flash over the USB-C cable with esptool, which talks to the onboard CH340C. Auto-reset works, so no button is needed. Back up the stock image first, then write the build:

```bash
# back up the original 4 MB image first
python -m esptool --chip esp32c2 --port COM3 read_flash 0x0 0x400000 stock-backup.bin

# write this firmware (merged image at 0x0)
python -m esptool --chip esp32c2 --port COM3 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 firmware.factory.bin
```

**NM-TV-154 (ESP32).** Flash over USB with esptool the same way as the C2, with `--chip esp32` and the `smalltv_esp32` build's `firmware.factory.bin`. Back up the stock image first (`read_flash 0x0 0x400000 stock-backup.bin`). Build the image from source with `pio run -e smalltv_esp32`; no prebuilt image is published yet.

After the first flash, every board updates from the browser under the web UI's Update tab.

## First-time setup

1. On first boot the device shows **SETUP MODE** and creates an open `SmallTV-Setup` hotspot.
2. Join it. A captive portal should open; if not, browse to `http://192.168.4.1`.
3. Open **WiFi**, scan, pick your 2.4 GHz network, enter the password, and save. The device reboots and joins.
4. It shows the network and its IP on screen (and `http://smalltv.local`). Browse to it.
5. Add a few tickers under **Symbols** (for example `AAPL`, `NESN.SW`, `BTC-USD`). Yahoo Finance is the default source, so it works immediately.

The [First-time setup guide](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/getting-started/setup/) walks through the web UI tab by tab.

## Documentation

Full docs live at **[giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/)**:

- [Hardware and variants](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/getting-started/hardware/) with pin maps for every board
- [Flashing](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/getting-started/flashing/) and [first-time setup](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/getting-started/setup/)
- The three modes: [ticker](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/features/ticker/), [Claude usage](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/features/usage/), [plane radar](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/features/radar/)
- [Data sources](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/reference/data-sources/), [building from source](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/reference/building/), and [recovery](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/reference/recovery/)

## Building from source

Requires [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). Pick the env for your board:

```bash
pio run -e smalltv                 # ESP8266
pio run -e smalltv_c2              # ESP32-C2
pio run -e smalltv_esp32           # NM-TV-154 (classic ESP32)
pio run -e smalltv_c2 -t upload    # build + flash the C2 over USB-C
pio device monitor -e smalltv_c2   # serial logs @ 115200
```

The three targets share one codebase. Chip differences live in `src/Platform.h` and the per-board pin headers (`src/board_esp8266.h`, `src/board_esp32c2.h`, `src/board_esp32.h`); the three feature modes and the web UI are identical across all of them. See [Building from source](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/reference/building/) for the project layout and the ESP32 toolchain notes.

The PC-side usage daemon lives in its own repo: [clawdmeter-daemon](https://github.com/giovi321/clawdmeter-daemon).
